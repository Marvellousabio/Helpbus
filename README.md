# MOBILITY — Accessible Transport System for Limb Disabilities

Reimagining transportation for people with limb disabilities in Nigeria and beyond.

# 🚀 Overview

MOBILITY is an accessible transportation system designed specifically for individuals with limb disabilities—amputees, stroke survivors, crutch users, and others with reduced mobility.

Our goal is simple:
Make transportation accessible, affordable, and dignifying.

**MOBILITY** introduces a hybrid model combining fixed accessible routes during peak hours and on-demand rides during off-peak periods, powered by an accessibility-first technology platform and locally adaptable vehicles.

This project was built initially for a hackathon challenge, with long-term plans for national and continental deployment.

#  💡 Problem We’re Solving

Millions of people with limb disabilities face daily transport challenges:

Public transport is too high-risk and physically inaccessible

Wheelchair-only services do not address needs of amputees and crutch users

No dedicated paratransit infrastructure exists in most African cities

Transportation limitations lead to job loss, social isolation, and missed medical care

The result?
A mobility gap that limits independence.

MOBILITY closes this gap.

# 🌍 Why Nigeria?

Over 20 million Nigerians live with disabilities

Public transport is not disability-friendly

No affordable, structured alternative exists

Rising urbanization makes demand stronger every year

MOBILITY is the first system designed around Nigerian realities, not imported assumptions.

Low-cost rider fares

NGO-sponsored trips

Government disability grants

CSR mobility sponsorships

Hospital/clinic transportation contracts

# 📊 Impact Goals

Improved independence for users

Reliable access to healthcare

Better employment mobility

Safer, more dignified transportation

Increased accessibility awareness across Africa

# 🎯 Hackathon Goals
